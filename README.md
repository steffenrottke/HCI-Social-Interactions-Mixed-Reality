To use the scripts, please open your console, move to the location of the folder and run the "server.js" file with "node server.js".

Next, open your browser and type "http://localhost:3000" into the URL window.

If you want to execute the script functions, click on the purple button with the text "Fetch Data" and wait (this might take a few seconds).

After the data got fetched, you can ask for any keyword and the script will loop through the gathered data and collect all the comments that match the keyword pattern.

It will automatically download the matching comments as a .json file into your downloads folder if by your browser.
